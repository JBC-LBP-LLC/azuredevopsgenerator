Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Azure DevOps Demo Generator!

## About this project

Organizations struggle with the number of tasks to adopt a cloud technology due to the lack of an agile methodology to plan, execute, and validate its initial success and deploy into production.

The purpose of this iniaitive is to simplify the process for organizations by providing DevOps templates for various cloud technologies; you can then use the Azure DevOps Demo Generator to import these into your own DevOps project. The templates include specific Work Items with actionable steps to implement the aforementioned cloud technologies.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote


If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.  Please use the template for each issue.
